# FLR VERSION NUMBERING SYSTEM

1. Development version numbers have three figures: major, minor and ISO-date without hyphens (e.g. 2.5.20030613).

2. Released version are of the form major.minor (e.g. 2.5).

3. Versions x.y.z are always development versions, and the date indicates the last
commit to git.

4. For release, the minor version number is increased (e.g. 2.5.20030613 is then
released as 2.6)
